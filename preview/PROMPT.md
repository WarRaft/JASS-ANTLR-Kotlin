A small but sturdy battle raft in the style of Warcraft, designed for a group of dwarven warriors. The raft is made of rough, dark wood bound together with iron bands and chains, adorned with dwarven runes, engravings, and small metal reinforcements. A few dwarves stand on the raft, armed with hammers, crossbows, and axes, ready for battle. Their armor is detailed and rugged, with intricate dwarven designs, and their beards are braided and adorned with metal rings. In the center of the raft, bold dwarven-style lettering carved into the wood reads 'CLI -jass2lua'. Floating above the raft in the center of the image is a glowing, detailed dwarven logo with the text 'JASS-ANTLR-Kotlin', featuring hammers, anvils, and runic patterns. The raft floats on a wild river surrounded by misty mountains and rocky cliffs. Dark, moody atmosphere, highly detailed, fantasy style, vibrant colors, cinematic lighting.
