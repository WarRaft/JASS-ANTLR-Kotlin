Create a logo in the style of Warcraft murlocs, featuring centered bold text "LNI" with bubbly, uneven effects and
glowing aqua green and blue edges. Place it on a murky, underwater emblem background with a primal and whimsical
atmosphere, inspired by murloc aesthetics. Use a slimy green and blue color scheme with glowing aqua accents. The
typography should be rough and organic, with murloc-inspired patterns like scales, bubbles, and seaweed integrated into
the emblem. The emblem should have an irregular, asymmetrical shape, textured with coral, barnacles, and glowing
underwater algae. The background should feature a dark, swampy lagoon with rippling water, glowing fish, and scattered
seashells. High-quality, 4K resolution.
