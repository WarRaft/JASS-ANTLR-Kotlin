An elegant elven battle raft in Warcraft style, mystical and serene atmosphere, crew of graceful elven warriors and
archers clad in intricate armor.

The raft is crafted from enchanted silverwood, bound together with glowing vines and adorned with delicate elven runes
and glowing crystals. On the side of the raft, elegant, flowing lettering reads '
JASS-ANTLR-Kotlin' in a refined, arcane script.

A large, glowing elven flag waves proudly at the back of the raft, featuring the stylized text '-jass2lua' in elegant,
glowing elven script, surrounded by swirling leaves and arcane
symbols.

Floating above the raft in the center of the image is a glowing, detailed elven emblem with intricate floral
patterns and a crescent moon. The raft glides on a shimmering, magical river surrounded by lush, ancient forests,
glowing mushrooms, and soft, ethereal light.

Mystical, enchanting atmosphere, highly detailed, fantasy style, cinematic
lighting, vibrant yet soothing colors.
