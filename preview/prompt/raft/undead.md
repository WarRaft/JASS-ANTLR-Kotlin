A necromantic battle raft in Warcraft style, dark and eerie atmosphere, crew of skeletons and zombies, the raft is made
of decaying wood bound together with rusty chains and adorned with glowing necrotic runes and bone fragments.

On the side of the raft, bold, weathered lettering reads 'JASS-ANTLR-Kotlin' in a sinister, undead style.

Floating above the raft in the center of the image is a glowing, detailed necromantic emblem with the text 'CLI
-jass2lua',
featuring skulls, dark magic swirls, and jagged, menacing designs.

The raft floats on a cursed, misty river surrounded by dead trees, jagged rocks, and faint ghostly apparitions.

Dark, moody atmosphere, highly detailed, fantasy style, vibrant colors, cinematic lighting.
