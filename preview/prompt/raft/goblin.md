Floating above the raft is a glowing, jagged goblin-style logo with green and yellow accents and a chaotic aura. The
lettering reads '-jass2jass' in a crude, scrawled font. On the raftâ€™s side, carved lettering reads 'JASS-ANTLR-Kotlin:
CLI' in a rough, uneven font, as if etched hastily.

Several goblins crowd the raft, their wiry forms buzzing with energy. They wear mismatched, scavenged armor adorned with
trinkets and glowing gadgets. Their beady eyes glint with mischief, and their sharp grins reveal crooked teeth. Some
tinker with devices, while others argue or shove each other, creating chaos.

The raft floats on a wild, muddy river surrounded by dense forests and mossy cliffs. The atmosphere is chaotic and wild,
with grungy colors, flickering torchlight, and a fantastical, slightly comedic tone. Highly detailed, the scene exudes
goblin-engineered mayhem.
